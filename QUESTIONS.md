# QUESTIONS
## A place to ask questions and get answers

- Should I be calculating the buy and sell thresholds based on the current price or just use a dynamic price for now
- How can I use the spread to determine if it will be a profitible opportunity
- What is the difference between an order, trade and position:
Order = What you want to do
Trade = What actually happened
Position = What you currently have
